# Handy Packages

A Swift Package Collection containing some handy packages I've made. By adding this package collection, you can easily add them to your projects just by typing the corresponding `import` statement in your code. Especially [HandyOperators](https://github.com/juliand665/HandyOperators) is one I use in pretty much every project these days.

## Usage

When browsing packages, click the plus button in the lower left corner to add a new package collection, and provide the following URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliand665/HandyPackages/main/collection.json`. This leads to the `collection.json` file contained in this repo.

## Notes

- Package collections require Xcode 13+
- It's not signed because that's a pain, but I think we can trust GitHub here.
